# Twheelie
This project contains the code to control my custom-designed two-legged robot on wheels, called Twheelie. It is still a work in progress, as I am currently waiting for a new ODrive motor controller for one of the wheels. I used two 3D-printed planetary gearboxes for the hip joints and two actuated scooter wheels to balance Twheelie.
